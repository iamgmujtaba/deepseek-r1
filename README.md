# DeepSeek-R1: Next-Generation Local Reasoning Model 

Experience cutting-edge reasoning directly in your browser with **DeepSeek-R1**, a 1.5B parameter model powered by WebGPU. Everything runs locally with **no data sent to servers**, ensuring privacy and performance. Built with ü§ó **Transformers.js** and **ONNX Runtime Web**, it‚Äôs lightweight, offline-capable, and blazing-fast at **60 tokens per second**. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf).

## Why DeepSeek-R1?

DeepSeek-R1 is designed for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who need a fast, secure, and privacy-focused reasoning model. By running locally in your browser, DeepSeek-R1 eliminates server latency and ensures complete control over your data.

## Features

- **Local Execution**: Runs entirely in your browser‚Äîno external dependencies or server-side processing using php.
- **WebGPU Acceleration**: Leverages WebGPU for fast, efficient computation.
- **Offline Support**: Once loaded, you can use the model without an internet connection.
- **Privacy First**: All processing stays on your device.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent, with source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/iamgmujtaba/deepseek-r1).

Note: Code is tested on MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu).
